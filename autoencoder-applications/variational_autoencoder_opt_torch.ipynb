    "# Conditional generation via Bayesian optimization in latent space\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently read [Automatic Chemical Design Using a Data-Driven Continuous Representation of Molecules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02415) by GoÃÅmez-Bombarelli et. al.<sup>[1]</sup> and it motivated me to experiment with the approaches described in the paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief summary of the paper. It describes how they use a variational autoencoder<sup>[2]</sup> for generating new chemical compounds with properties that are of interest for drug discovery. For training, they used a large database of chemical compounds whose properties of interest are known. The variational autoencoder can encode compounds into 196-dimensional latent space representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By sampling from the continuous latent space new compounds can be generated e.g. by sampling near a known compound to generate slight variations of it or by interpolating between more distant compounds. By simply autoencoding chemical compounds, however, they were not able organize latent space w.r.t. properties of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To additionally organize latent space w.r.t. these properties they jointly trained the variational autoencoder with a predictor that predicts these properties from latent space representations. Joint training with a predictor resulted in a latent space that reveals a gradient of these properties. This gradient can then be used to drive search for new chemical compounds into regions of desired properties. The following figure, copied from the paper<sup>[1]</sup>, summarizes the approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "![vae-chem](images/vae-opt/vae-chem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For representing compounds in structure space, they use [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) strings which can be converted to and from structural representations using standard computational chemistry software. For the encoder network, they experimented with both, 1D-CNNs and RNNs, for the decoder network they used a RNN. Architecure details are described in the paper. The predictor is a small dense neural network. For optimization in latent space i.e. for navigating into regions of desired properties they use a Bayesian optimization approach with Gaussian processes as surrogate model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors open-sourced their [chemical variational autoencoder](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae) but didn't publish code related to Bayesian optimization, at least not at the time of writing this article. So I decided to start some experiments but on a toy dataset that is not related to chemistry at all: the [MNIST handwritten digits dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). All methods described in the paper can be applied in this context too and results are easier to visualize and probably easier to grasp for people not familiar with chemistry. The only property associated with the MNIST dataset is the label or value of the digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, it will be shown how to conditionally generate new digits by following a gradient in latent space. In other words, it will be shown how to navigate into regions of latent space that decode into digit images of desired target label. I'm also going to adress the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does joint training with a predictor change the latent space of a variational autoencoder?\n",
    "- How can useful optimization objectives be designed?\n",
    "- How can application of Bayesian optimization methods be justified?\n",
    "- What are possible alternatives to this approach? \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll leave experiments with the chemical compounds dataset and the public chemical VAE for another article. The following assumes some basic familiarity with [variational autoencoders](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning/blob/dev/autoencoder-applications/variational_autoencoder.ipynb), [Bayesian otpimization](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning/blob/dev/bayesian-optimization/bayesian_optimization.ipynb) and [Gaussian processes](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning/blob/dev/gaussian-processes/gaussian_processes.ipynb).

For example, if the desired target label is 5 the optimization objective must have an optimum in that region of the latent space where images with a 5 are located. Also remember that the variational distributions i.e. the distributions of codes in latent space have been regularized to be close to the standard normal distribution during model training (see *regularization term* in `vae_loss`). This regularization term should also be considered in the optimization objective to avoid directing search too far from the origin.\n",

    "Hence the optimization objective should not only reflect the probability that a sample corresponds to an image of desired target label but also the standard normal probability distribution. In the following, we will use an optimization objective $f$ that is the negative logarithm of the product of these two terms:\n",

The corresponding optimization objective is visualized in the following figure."
